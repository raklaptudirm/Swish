# Swish types are Swift types

Status: **planned**, as phase 5 of [static types](types.md). It replaces
"typed plugins" there and the old milestone 9 (URLs, versions, bridges).

Decided:

- **One type system: Swift's.** The checker has no types of its own.
  `Int`, `String`, `[T]`, `Date`, `URL` are the standard library's and
  Foundation's, with every member Swift gives them; a package's types are
  its own; Swish's own (`FileSize`, `Output`, `FileEntry`, `Job`) are
  declared in Swift, in SwishKit, and read the same way.
- **Representation: generated Swift twins.** The interpreter keeps its own
  representation of values; at the boundary with Swift, values convert,
  and a struct or enum declared in Swish gets a generated Swift twin, so it
  can go where Swift wants a real type (`decode(Config.self, …)`,
  `Set<Point>`).

Any Swift package or SDK module is used from Swish with nothing written for
Swish: no `@SwishExport`, no wrapper package.

```swift
"a,b,c".split(separator: ",")              // Swift's own String and Sequence methods
Date().addingTimeInterval(3600)

import Foundation
let url = URL(string: "https://swift.org")!
url.appendingPathComponent("docs").host    // "swift.org"

struct Config: Decodable { var name: String; var port: Int }
let config = try JSONDecoder().decode(Config.self, from: Data($(cat config.json).text.utf8))

import Yams from "https://github.com/jpsim/Yams"
let doc = try Yams.load(yaml: $(cat config.yml).text)
```

`@SwishExport` stays: it's the way to shape a command line (`@Flag`,
`@Input`, doc comments as `--help`) for a package written for Swish.

## One type system

- **The standard library and Foundation are read, not written down.** The
  checker's hand-written members (`count`, `lines`, `first` and the like)
  and most of the prelude give way to Swift's own declarations, read from
  their symbol graphs. So `filter`, `map`, `sorted(by:)`, `contains`,
  `split`, `uppercased()` and the rest are Swift's, with Swift's
  signatures and overloads.
- **Swish's own types are Swift declarations,** in SwishKit: `FileSize`,
  `Output`, `Status`, `FileEntry`, `ProcessEntry`, `Job`, `Member`,
  `Help`. What only a shell needs (`sorted(by:)` with a key path, `get`,
  `select`, `uniqued()`, `prefix` with a default) are Swift extensions
  there too. The prelude keeps only what isn't Swift: which builtins are
  commands, and their command lines (`@flag`, `@input`).
- **Types declared in Swish** are ordinary types to the checker: a Swish
  `struct Config: Decodable` is a `Config` that is `Decodable`, and can be
  passed where Swift wants one.
- **What Swish adds to Swift's rules:** commands and pipelines (their
  stages typed as now), `$(…)`, an `Output` being its text where a String
  is wanted, and literal command-line words converted to their
  parameters' types.

## Why glue is still compiled

Swift can read a value's fields at run time (`Mirror`), but it can't call a
function or method by name. So calling Swift from an interpreter takes
compiled glue: a thunk per function that converts arguments, calls it and
converts the result back. Swish writes and compiles that glue itself.

Compiling Swish itself to Swift (so every value would be a native Swift
value) would remove the conversions, but costs a compile per entry at the
prompt and a second execution engine; the twins below get the same result
for types at the boundary without it. It remains possible later, for
scripts, reusing the twins.

## How

1. **Resolve and build.** `import Name from "url"` (or a path, or an SDK
   module with no `from`) resolves the package with SwiftPM, pinned in a
   lock file beside the script or in the shell's state directory, and
   builds it. The standard library and Foundation are always there.
2. **Read its declarations.** `swift package dump-symbol-graph` (for
   packages) or `swift-symbolgraph-extract` (for SDK modules and the
   standard library) gives every public declaration with its full Swift
   signature: parameters, labels, generics and constraints, `throws`,
   `async`, doc comments. The checker loads these as it loads the
   prelude, so calls are checked against Swift's real signatures, and
   `help` and completion know them. Both tools come with the Command Line
   Tools. A graph can be large (Foundation's is 44 MB of JSON), so it's
   read once into a compact index, cached, and looked up by name as names
   are used.
3. **Generate glue for what's used.** After checking, the shell knows each
   declaration the program touches, with concrete generic arguments
   (`JSONDecoder().decode(Config.self, from:)`). It writes a Swift file
   with a thunk for each, and a twin for each Swish type that crosses, and
   compiles it into a dylib against the packages.
4. **Cache it.** Dylibs are cached by the symbols and twins they hold, the
   packages' versions and the compiler's. The first use of an API pays one
   compile (a second or two, with a progress hint as for "Building…");
   after that it loads at once, in any shell.

## Values across the boundary

- **Values with a Swish representation convert:** numbers, `String`,
  `Bool`, `Date`, arrays, dictionaries, optionals, tuples, and the values of
  Swish-declared structs and enums (through their twins).
- **Swift twins:** for a struct or enum declared in Swish that crosses
  into Swift, the glue declares a Swift type with the same name, fields
  (or cases), types and conformances (`Equatable`, `Hashable`, `Codable`,
  `Comparable` for enums), and converts values to and from it at the call.
  Methods stay in Swish; a Swift API that calls one (a `Comparable` twin's
  `<`) is out of scope at first.
- **Everything else is held as it is:** a Swift value the interpreter has
  no representation for (`URL`, `Data`, `Yams.Node`) is kept as the Swift
  value, of its Swift type, and passes back into Swift unchanged. To the
  checker and to you it's just a `URL`.
- **Closures:** a Swish closure passed where Swift wants one is wrapped by
  the thunk, so `swiftArray.map { … }` works.

## Steps

1. **The standard library's members on Swish values**, from its symbol
   graph and generated glue, replacing the hand-written member tables.
2. **Swish's own types in SwishKit**, read the same way; the prelude
   shrinks to command lines.
3. **Packages and SDK modules** imported by URL, path or name.
4. **Twins** for Swish types that cross into Swift.

## Not at first

`inout` parameters, operators, protocols with associated types as values
(`some Collection`), Swift calling back into a Swish type's methods,
subclassing Swift classes from Swish, and async beyond waiting for it to
finish.
